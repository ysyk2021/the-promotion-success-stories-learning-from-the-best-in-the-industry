This analysis helps identify competitive advantages, understand consumer preferences, and develop unique promotion ideas.

### 3. Customer Surveys and Feedback

Directly engaging with customers through surveys and feedback mechanisms allows businesses to collect first-hand insights on successful promotions. Conducting surveys enables organizations to understand customer preferences, their perceptions of past promotions, and their expectations for future initiatives. Analyzing this data provides valuable insights into consumer behavior and helps tailor promotions to meet customer needs.
